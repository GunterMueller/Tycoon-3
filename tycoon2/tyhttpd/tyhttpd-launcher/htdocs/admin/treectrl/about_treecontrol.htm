<p><b>Presentation</b></p>

<p>In developing the applet some effort was made to give the Tree Control an MS Windows
look and feel. Each item needed to have its own icon and title text and I looked into some
sort of pop up tool tips information but that gave way to a status bar information
instead. The Tree Control doesn't have a flow effect as items are added and removed but I
feel that it does have the important qualities that make the windows tree control and
effective way to present information. </p>
<b>

<p>Purpose</p>
</b>

<p>The Tree Control was developed to index a series on html pages in another project and
soon found its way to indexing my web site. I knew what I wanted and had looked around the
web for a tree control like applet to index the information. But all the controls I found
although some where were excellent as far as functionality was concerned they where mostly
for Java 1.1 which wasn't as backward compatible as I needed. So I decided to write one
myself.</p>
<b>

<p>Content</b><br>
I have written some documentation to aid people who wish to use the applet. Though rather
brief at present I will endeavor to update it in the near future. The applet on the whole
was designed to be easy to use with a small selection of prama tags and a concise set of
item arguments. Also the complete source is online if you wish to ferret out other
possibilities. If you have any problems I would be happy to help.</p>
<b>

<p>Source code </p>
</b>

<p>The Tree Control applet was developed in Java 1.0 so I was limited in the components I
could call upon. At the core of the design I had to hold menu items and their child parent
relationships. What I decided on was to have each item control and contain its self and
its children. A parent item has control of laying out its children and handing on input.
This recursive behavior greatly simplified the top-level interface as it need only
allocate a single root level directory item and pass all input through that.</p>

<p>The issue of refreshing the screen and handling the scrolling mechanisms was handed to
a scrolling panel interface. This allowed the control to be drawn to a off screen bitmap
which made the control more responsive. Another issue was making the adding and deleting
of items as simple as possible. This involved parsing a complex set of item string
arguments and options but this broke down easily with StringTokenizer.</p>
<b>

<p>Performance </p>
</b>

<p>My main aim in developing the Tree Control was to add it to web pages so the greater
part of the tuning was done to reduce code size and to eliminate some class files. If its
too big it will take so long to come up that nobody will use it. My aim was 20k and I got
it under that but the new version has blown out to 25k. </p>
<b>

<p>Future Plans</b> <br>
Originally I had designed each item to have an activation sound and a background image for
the applet but this was dropped in order to keep the applet size and complexity down.
Issues involving a great number of items have to be looked at as the applet gets slow at
about 150 items and above. I will leave it in Java 1.0 for the present as there seems to
be more interest for is backward compatibility. If anyone has some ideas I would be
interested also the code is online for those that feel more ambitious.</p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Things that have been suggested and are being looked at are
an external file defined items, better highlighting of items with mouse over, tileing and
positioning of the background image, dotted lines between items, being able to use the /
and \ slashes in item names and support for foreign language fonts. </font></p>
