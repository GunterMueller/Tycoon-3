  tosMd5.h 1.0 final  16-OCT-1998  Andre Willomat

  Interface to Portable Tycoon-2 operating system (TycoonOS)

  MD5 algorithm taken from rfc1321.
  This code is in the public domain.
  All pasted into one file, without mddriver.c (Tycoon is the driver)
  MD5Foo entry points made static, new entry points:

  tosMd5_init,
     allocate and call MD5Init

  tosMd5_update,
     tycoon interface: buffer + offset

  tosMd5_final
     finalize and free context
