   Tycoon Business Conversations (TBC) for Tycoon 2
   ------------------------------------------------
   Abstract superclass for customer-rules.  In its subclasses the customer-side 
   of rules to execute a TBC is to be implemented.  For each dialog a rule has 
   to be registered at the related CustomerRole.  Therfore, a method "handle" 
   exists, which must be overridden to implement the handling of the dialog.  
   "handle" is called with the Dialog received by the performer.  Its contents 
   can be inspected and altered.  'handle' must return a valid request which
   is passed together with the altered dialog back to the performer.
   Furthermore, to keep track of the session, "handle" is passed the current 
   Conversation.
