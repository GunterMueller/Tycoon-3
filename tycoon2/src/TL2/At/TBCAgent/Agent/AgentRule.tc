   Tycoon Business Conversations (TBC) for Tycoon 2
   ------------------------------------------------
   Abstract superclass for customer- and performer-rules.

   In subclasses of rules the application-logic of an agent is to be 
   implemented, decoupled from the processing of the conversation: the 
   necessary communication and other housekeeping like creating instances
   of contents, accounting etc. 

   A (more esoteric) view:
   Executing a Tycoon Business Conversation by an agent means running a 
   (distributed) NFA, where the dialogs are equivalent to states and the 
   requests are to transitions.  The decision which request is sent from 
   the customer to the performer can be seen as the input of the automat 
   and is accomplished by the 'customer rule'.  The decision of the request 
   may be dependent of the contents.  Because of the nondeterminism, a 
   second rule, the 'performer rule', which selects the next dialog (or 
   state) is necessary.  This rule decides, based on the received request 
   and constrained by the possible replies (a set of dialogs) which dialog 
   (with which contents) to send back to the customer.  Of course, the 
   decision is influenced by the contents the customer entered or altered 
   in the last dialog.
