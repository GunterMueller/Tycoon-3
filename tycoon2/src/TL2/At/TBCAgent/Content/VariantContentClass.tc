   Tycoon Business Conversation (TBC) for Tycoon 2
   -----------------------------------------------
   Metaclass for VariantContent. It is responsible for creating an instance 
   with an default variant.
   ### Another possible solution: Allow a state where no variant is 
   selected, ie. the value is nil. This would be the default value.
   An additional benefit would be the possibility to express optional values.
