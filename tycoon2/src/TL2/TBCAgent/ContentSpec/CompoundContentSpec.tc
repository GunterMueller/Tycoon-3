   Tycoon Business Conversation (TBC) for Tycoon 2
   -----------------------------------------------
   Abstract superclass for compound content-specification for records and 
   variants, whose members are named.  Each such compound spec is a 
   dictionary, containing name/contentspec-pairs, since content-specs in a 
   compound must be named, according to the TBC-grammar.  Note that at least
   in this implementation the order of elements is not important, eg. a 
   specification of "Record Bla Blubb end" matches "Record Blubb Bla end" -- 
   although Dictionary may imply an order of its elements.  This is true for 
   the related contents as well.
