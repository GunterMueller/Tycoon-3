   Tycoon Business Conversations (TBC) for Tycoon 2
   ------------------------------------------------
   This is the abstract root-class for all
   Tycoon-Business-Conversation-Specification-visitor-classes.
   Subclasses of this visitor may be used to "visit" an entire conversation-
   specification. For every contained class there is an abstract visit-
   method. For ContentSpecs and Contents this is accomplished by inheriting
   from the related abstract vistor superclasses, so there are just 3
   additionaly methods for Conversation-, Dialog- and RequestSpecs
   necessary.
   For example see TBCSpecPrettyPrinter.tc.
