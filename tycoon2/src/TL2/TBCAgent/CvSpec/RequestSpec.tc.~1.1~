   Tycoon Business Conversation (TBC) for Tycoon 2
   -----------------------------------------------
   Specification of requests.  Each request-spec (which are aggregated in 
   dialog-specs by a dictionary) has a list of possible replies, ie.  
   dialog-specs.  This is implemented by being dictionary by inheritance.  
   The name of a request-spec can only be retrieved from the dictionary 
   containing it, ie. the dialog-spec.
