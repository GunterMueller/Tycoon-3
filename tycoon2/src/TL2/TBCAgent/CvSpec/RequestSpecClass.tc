   Tycoon Business Conversation (TBC) for Tycoon 2
   -----------------------------------------------
   Specification of requests. Each request (a component aggregated in 
   dialog-specs by a dictionary) has a list of possible replies, ie. 
   dialog-specs. this is implemented by a dictionary, too. The name of the 
   request can only be retrieved from the dictionary containing it, ie. the 
   dialog-spec.
