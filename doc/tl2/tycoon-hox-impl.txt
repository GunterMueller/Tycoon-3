This document describes the differences between the Tycoon 1.0 language as
defined in the "Report on the Tycoon-2 Programming Language Version 1.0" and
the implementation available at Higher-Order.

1. Implementation Restrictions

Tycoon Version 1.0 has the following limitations:

o Formal parameter lists in fun expressions and function types are restricted
to positional value parameters.

o Keyword arguments are not generally supported. Only a fixed set of keyword
arguments in the standard system library are hardwired into the compiler.
The for method does not support the step: keyword.

o Keyword parameter declarations are only recognized syntactically but not
semantically.

o pre- and postconditions are recognized syntactically and are scoped.  "old"
expressions are not treated correctly, but are incorrectly normalized to
message send with selector "old".  No code is generated for pre- or
postconditions, and they are not typechecked.

o ...number of arguments...

o ...number of local variables...
