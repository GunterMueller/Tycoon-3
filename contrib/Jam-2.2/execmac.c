 * execunix.c - execute a shell script on UNIX
 *
 * If $(JAMSHELL) is defined, uses that to formulate execvp().
 * The default is:
 *
 *	/bin/sh -c %
 *
 * Each word must be an individual element in a jam variable value.
 *
 * In $(JAMSHELL), % expands to the command string and ! expands to 
 * the slot number (starting at 1) for multiprocess (-j) invocations.
 * If $(JAMSHELL) doesn't include a %, it is tacked on as the last
 * argument.
 *
 * Don't just set JAMSHELL to /bin/sh - it won't work!
 *
 * External routines:
 *	execcmd() - launch an async command execution
 * 	execwait() - wait and drive at most one execution completion
 *
 * Internal routines:
 *	onintr() - bump intr to note command interruption
 *
 * 04/08/94 (seiwald) - Coherent/386 support added.
 * 05/04/94 (seiwald) - async multiprocess interface
 * 01/22/95 (seiwald) - $(JAMSHELL) support
