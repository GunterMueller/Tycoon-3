 * FILENAME - a name of a file, broken into <grist>dir/base/suffix(member)
 *
 * <grist> is salt to distinguish between targets that otherwise would
 * have the same name:  it never appears in the bound name of a target.
 * (member) is an archive member name: the syntax is arbitrary, but must 
 * agree in file_parse(), file_build() and the Jambase.
 *
 * On VMS, we keep track of whether the original path was a directory
 * (without a file), so that $(VAR:D) can climb to the parent.
